# Inventory

Once the appropriate category has been created, inventory can then be assigned to that category.

An "Inventory Item" can be anything. The smallest screw, to the biggest transform. What you wish to store as inventory is entirely up to you.

An inventory item is made up of the following tabs and fields:

* ## General Information

  * **Name**
    * The name of the inventory.
  * **SKU **

    * The unique SKU of the inventory.

  * **Slug**

    * The unique identifier which appears in the address bar.

  * **Description**

    * The description of the inventory.
    * _note_: Unlike before, do not enter inventory-specific features/specification such as rating, voltage, year, cost, etc. in the inventory description. There is a new tab called `Specification` that contains all the products features. This allows the product to be searchable and comparable to other inventory. 

  * **Parent item **

    * The parent item of the inventory item.
    * Does this inventory item belong to another inventory item? For example, imagine you had a parent inventory of `Car` already, and you were adding a `Steering Wheel` inventory item, you would select `Car` are the parent item, this would result in the `Steering Wheel` being displayed on the `Car` inventory page.

  * **Category**

    * The category the inventory item belongs to.
