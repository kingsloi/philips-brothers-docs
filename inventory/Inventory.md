# Inventory

Once the appropriate category has been created, inventory can then be assigned to that category. 

An "Inventory Item" can be anything. The smallest screw, to the biggest transform. What you wish to store as inventory is entirely up to you.

An inventory item is made up of the following sections:

* General Information
  * **Name**
    * The name of the inventory
  * **SKU **
    * The unique SKU of the inventory

  * **Slug**
    * The unique identifier which appears in the address bar
  * **Description**
    * The description of the inventory
    * 
  * **Parent item **
  * **Category**
* **Images**
* **Files**
* **Inventory**
  * **Quantity**
  * **Row**
  * **Section**
* **Specification**
