# Plan Management

##### Note: only logged-in admin users/Philips Brother staff have access to the pages from here on in.

In the following chapters, you'll learn how to manage all aspects of the plans, such as their status', and how many users have favourited each plan.

Customers can login and "favourite" plans which interest them. Customers who have favourited plans will get notified whenever a plan is edited.
